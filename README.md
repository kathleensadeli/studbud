Following the pitch submitted for Assessment 2, mockups were sketched and finalized for each modal. The mockups are then tested with potential users who fit the personas made in the pitch. I conducted a simple usability test, allowing 4 participants to explore the prototype digitally (desktop format). I asked them post-test questions about their first impressions and what they disliked and liked about each page. These were the critical feedback based on each section:

Task list → Users liked how they could prioritize their work based on colors and tags and the flexibility of editing and adding columns. However, users are worried about the layout of the cards if they exceed the given space of the column. 

Bookmarks → Despite liking the ability to keep all their resources organized in groups and access them individually or as a group, there is still some confusion with the clicking positions for editing and opening the link itself. 

Clock (stopwatch+timer) → Users found the stopwatch and timer easy to understand and use. They mentioned how they prefer having the time to stop after one proportion of the timer is finished, so they have the flexibility to start the following proportion.

Music → Users liked the simple layout of the song cards and found the large sizes of the cards easy to select, but they found studying pop songs distracting and preferred having lo-fi beats instead.

I created a rough sketch of what the column/group should look like if the cards exceed their space. My initial design would have the column merely extended to fit the new cards added. Adding cards vertically to the task list was simple; every resource card will add up vertically, following every third horizontal card.

On self-reflection, having users scroll through many resource cards in one group to get to the next will be time-consuming. Therefore, it is better to implement a horizontal scroll bar to “hide” unnecessary cards for a more efficient display. Implementing a vertical line to the task list as well, I realized that it is helpful for users to still be able to see the progress label no matter how far they scroll down.

As I moved on to coding the application itself, I ensured I fulfilled user needs and feedback throughout the process. However, I did encounter some challenges with dynamic points that have impacted the several functionalities of the application. Tasks cannot be dragged and dropped as there were difficulties finding dynamic points for card relocation and changing its progress status, especially when there is a lot of data. Furthermore, the music player will be refreshed to the default song “bedtime after a coffee” every time the user clicks on a page. The dynamic nature of the song and the time elapsed makes it challenging to keep track of. This is the same reason why the clock is refreshed every time the user switches pages.

This application can be improved in many ways. By implementing a solution to ensure music and clock progress won’t be affected no matter the page. It is essential to customize further and delete columns and groups. The ability to add resources without putting them into a group can make the bookmark page more flexible. To enhance the music page, users can have the option to externally or internally browse music, add other songs and possibly create personalized playlists.
